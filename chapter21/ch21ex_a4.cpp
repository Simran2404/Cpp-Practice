or a marsupial (koala, wombat, etc.). The information whether a particular animal is canine, feline, cetacean, or marsupial is 
stored in bit number 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively of a integer variable called type. Bit number 4 of the variable type stores 
the information about whether the animal is Carnivore or Herbivore. For the following animal, complete the program to 
determine whether the animal is a herbivore or a carnivore. Also determine whether the animal is a canine, feline,
